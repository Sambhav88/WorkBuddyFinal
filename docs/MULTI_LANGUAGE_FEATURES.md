# Multi-Language Features in WorkBuddy

## Overview
WorkBuddy supports three languages:
- English (default)
- Hindi (हिंदी)
- Marathi (मराठी)

The language selection is persistent across sessions using localStorage.

## Implementation Details

### 1. Language Selector
A language selector dropdown is available in the header of all pages:
- Positioned in the top-right corner
- Available on all pages (home, registration, dashboard, etc.)
- Options: English, Hindi, Marathi

### 2. Translation System
The translation system is implemented in `frontend/js/translations.js`:

#### Structure
```javascript
const translations = {
  en: {
    // English translations
    workbuddy: "WorkBuddy",
    home: "Home",
    // ... more translations
  },
  hi: {
    // Hindi translations
    workbuddy: "वर्कबडी",
    home: "होम",
    // ... more translations
  },
  mr: {
    // Marathi translations
    workbuddy: "वर्कबडी",
    home: "होम",
    // ... more translations
  }
};
```

#### Functions
- `getCurrentLanguage()`: Returns the currently selected language from localStorage
- `setCurrentLanguage(lang)`: Sets the language and updates the page content
- `translateElement(element, key)`: Translates a specific element
- `translatePage()`: Translates all elements with `data-translate` attributes

### 3. HTML Implementation
To make an element translatable, add the `data-translate` attribute with the translation key:

```html
<h1 data-translate="heroTitle">Connecting Skilled Workers with Customers</h1>
<p data-translate="heroDescription">Find reliable plumbers, electricians, painters...</p>
```

### 4. CSS Styling
The language selector is styled in `frontend/css/styles.css` with:
- Transparent background with white text
- Border styling to match the header
- Responsive design for mobile devices

## How It Works

1. **Language Selection**: User selects a language from the dropdown
2. **Storage**: The selected language is stored in localStorage
3. **Translation**: All elements with `data-translate` attributes are updated
4. **Persistence**: The selected language is remembered across page visits

## Adding New Languages

1. Add the language code to the translations object in `translations.js`
2. Add translations for all existing keys
3. Add the language option to all language selectors in HTML files
4. Update the CSS if needed for the new language

## Adding New Translatable Elements

1. Add the `data-translate` attribute to the HTML element
2. Add the translation key to all language objects in `translations.js`
3. The element will be automatically translated when the language changes

## Files Modified for Multi-Language Support

- `frontend/js/translations.js` - Core translation system
- `frontend/css/styles.css` - Language selector styling
- `frontend/html/home.html` - Homepage with language selector
- `frontend/html/customer-registration.html` - Customer registration page
- `frontend/html/worker-registration.html` - Worker registration page
- `frontend/html/worker-dashboard.html` - Worker dashboard page
- `frontend/html/multilanguage-demo.html` - Demo page for testing
- `verify_multilanguage.js` - Verification script

## Testing

To test the multi-language feature:
1. Open `home.html` in a browser
2. Select a different language from the dropdown
3. Verify that all translatable elements update correctly
4. Navigate to other pages and confirm the language persists
5. Refresh the page and confirm the language setting is remembered

## Verification

A verification script (`verify_multilanguage.js`) is included to:
- Check that all translation files are loaded correctly
- Verify that all languages have complete translations
- Confirm that all required translation functions exist
- Validate that the language selector is properly implemented
- Test that translatable elements are correctly marked

Run the verification by opening the browser console and checking for messages.
